Master's level course where we teach the students the basics of energy systems planning. The course is divided into two
parts: the first one, taught by a different instructor, is about the basics energy systems modeling using optimization,
while the second, the one taught by me, is about data analysis and manipulation to run the optimization problems. In my 
part, the students familiarize themselves with the data sources, tools and common practices used in energy systems
modeling, they also have an initial exposure to the application of machine learning in energy systems modeling.
