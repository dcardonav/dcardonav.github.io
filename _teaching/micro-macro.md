Master's level course where we teach the students the basics of economics. The course is divided into two
parts: the first one, taught by a different instructor, lays the microeconomic foundations like basic utility theory,
consumer theory and basic industrial organization. The second part, the one taught by me, is about macroeconomics,
where students learn about general concepts like GDP, inflation, unemployment, and the role of the government
in the economy; and also they learn about how all of these affect business decisions and everyday life of the people.
