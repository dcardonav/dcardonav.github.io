Master's level course where we teach the students the basics of the interplay between the environment and energy 
related activities. The course is divided into two parts: the first one, taught by me, lays the economic foundations
about natural resource economics; there, the students learn concepts like the externalities, public goods and
environmental valuation. The second part, taught by a different instructor, focuses on recent technologies with an
emphasis of lifecycle analysis.
