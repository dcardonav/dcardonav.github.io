In this talk, we present the results of applying a recently developed method, called Basis-Oriented time series 
aggregation, to improve the tractability of energy system models. We use machine learning techniques on previous runs 
to identify independent partitions of the time index that allow for a parallelized run of the model; greatly improving
the running times of large scale optimization models.
