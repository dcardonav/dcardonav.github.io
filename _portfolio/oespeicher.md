My work in this project consisted of the data preparation and initial runs of a European-scale energy system model.
I developed several scripts and data integration tools that allowed me to merge different data sources and formats into
a consolidated input data set for the model. Some of the data sources that I used were: the ENTSO-e ten year network
development plan as well as Austria and Germany ones, techno-economic data related to the energy production technologies,
and additional data provided by the APG.

**Skills Involved:** Data engineering, scripting, data validation, energy systems modeling, computer programming
