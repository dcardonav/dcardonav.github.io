The medium and long-term variability of renewable energies represents an unprecedented systemic challenge.
The exploratory project MILES is investigating the demand assessment, system integration and technology-neutral 
evaluation of medium- and long-term storage technologies in the context of the EAG targets. For this purpose, 
regression models of relevant processes are created and evaluated on the basis of systemic investigations within the 
entire Austrian electricity system. 
My participation in this project was concerned with setting up the energy system model and data preparation. I was also
tasked with researching potential business cases for different storage technologies and analyzing whether they fit into
the current regulatory landscape.

**Skills involved:** Techno-economic modeling, data engineering, computer programming
