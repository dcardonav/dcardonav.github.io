The medium and long-term variability of renewable energies represents an unprecedented systemic challenge.
The exploratory project MILES is investigating the demand assessment, system integration and technology-neutral 
evaluation of medium- and long-term storage technologies in the context of the EAG targets. For this purpose, 
regression models of relevant processes are created and evaluated on the basis of systemic investigations within the 
entire Austrian electricity system. 
The results serve as a basis for the derivation of concrete market models in order to find Austrian consortia for 
technology research and to develop technology-specific market models.
