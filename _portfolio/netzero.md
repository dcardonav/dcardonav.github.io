Models of realistic power systems are usually so large that even supercomputers are pushed towards their performance 
limits. This means that much input data (such as time series of power demand or capacity factors of renewable energy 
sources) is aggregated, which makes the models numerically solvable but less accurate. Sonja Wogrin, head of the 
Institute of Electricity Economics and Energy Innovation at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), wants to change 
this with her five-year project “Optimisation and data aggregation for net-zero power systems”, for which she has 
secured a Starting Grant of almost 1.5 million euros from the European Research Council (ERC). [^1]

My work in this project consists on researching mathematical properties of energy system optimization models that allow 
for their temporal disaggregation; with the goal of achieving large computational gains in their
solutions. Also, as part of my work, I am to develop a methodology to apply our findings to real world models.

**Skills involved:**: Data analysis, machine learning, mathematical modeling, energy systems modeling, computer programming
