I am a computer engineer and economist with a master's in systems engineering and over 10 years of experience in the fields of data analytics, energy systems optimization, energy markets, and finance. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on multiple projects, applying data analysis and economics to address complex challenges in the energy sector.

I'm in the final year of my doctorate studies in electrical engineering in Austria. My research focuses on improving the computational tractability of large-scale energy system optimization models used to explore the integration of renewable energy and new technologies into the grids and the changes required in the markets.

I have a passion for sharing and acquiring knowledge, so I've taught graduate-level courses and co-supervised master theses related to energy planning, project finance, and foundational economics; this has allowed me to share my experience and help students develop a deeper understanding of these critical topics. In addition to my teaching experience, I've worked on several research and consulting projects in the last few years, collaborating with fellow researchers to find solutions for improving energy systems modeling. During my time in the private sector, prior to my doctoral studies, I worked on multiple projects concerning the regulation of electricity markets and led the analytics team of a large utility.
